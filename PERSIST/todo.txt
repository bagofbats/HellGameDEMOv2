programming:
 - main menu
 - saving/reloading
 - inventory
 - have tilting the joystick just a little bit make trigo walk slowly?
 - interactable little guys on the reused level parts
 - have some collapsable blocks go behind styx
 - think harder abt dashing and attacking at the same time
 - have different levels be able to load/unload sounds from audio manager
   so all the sounds aren't always loaded into memory all the time
 - check whether Lukas has to update the projectiles himself
 - give shockwave better hit box
 - doors out of secret areas should give dialogue box
 - clamp mushroom boss's X pos to be inside the zone at all times

art:
 - more advanced dust animation when blocks switch?
 - particle effects on wall slide
 - particle effects in general
 - animation for big slime dropping the ranger medallion
 - adjust in-air sprites to be less misleading abt hitbox
 - death animation for mushroom ppl
 - adjust trigo's in-air sprites to better align with hitbox??

 bugs:
 - ranged attacks get stopped by one-way platforms
 - ranged attack particle vfx fuckin sugks
    - if the particle breaks on the corner of a wall the poof vfx is misplaced
 - have it so when kanna jumps away from you she still fires the arrow in your direction
 - try chaning frame rate to see if anything breaks

 area plan:
  - on new save file:
     - show player the controls menu, start opening cutscene when they hit "done"
